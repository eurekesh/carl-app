        <h1>Meet Julia!</h1>
        <p> My name is Julia Troni. I was born and raised in Littleton, Colorado. I have 3 younger siblings and a dog named KylieThePoopie.
            I am a student at CU Boulder pursuing a major in Computer Science Engineering and minors in Spanish and Business.
            I am also a barista at Starbuck and spend lots of time babysitting and pet sitting.
            In my free time I enjoy staying active and exploring the outdoors. I am very into hiking, weight lifting and swimming.Â </p>
