        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>Hello There! My name is Annikka Leaf, I'm 19 years old and I'm from Sacramento California.</p>
        <p>I love sports, tech, and movies. I was an ice hockey goalie for 11 years and even tried to play in college, but decided to focus more on earning a degree in computer science.</p>

        <h2>Education: </h2>
        <p>I graduated from Granite Bay Highschool in the spring of 2019 and am currently a sophomore at CU Boulder studying computer science. I hope in the future to have
            a career in theme park engineering and ride design.</p>
